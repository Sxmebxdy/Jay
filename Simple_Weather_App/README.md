## Getting Started
Welcome to my easy and simple WeatherApp. In order to get the App to work you have to follow these simple instructions:
1. Sign up at weatherapi.com and get your API key. (its free and simple)
2. Create a .env file (this file should be named only .env, otherwhise the load_dotenv() method will not do anything)
3. Add API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE into the .env file
4. Run the WeatherApp
