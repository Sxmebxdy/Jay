Hi, im Jay,
I study computer science at the university of Paderborn, Germany. I am 18 and got into coding quite a while ago. I havent had much time sharing or commenting any of the works i have done in the past. I want to use this profile, to share some insights of tools, scripts, projects and more i do while studying and in private. Feel free to comment on anything anytime.
